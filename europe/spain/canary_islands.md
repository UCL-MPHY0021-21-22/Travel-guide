# Canary Islands

The main reason people visit the Canary Islands is because they want to relax. Letting everything go and just feel the sun on their skin, and dip their toes in the sea every now and then. And in the evening you can have a lovely Spanish meal with your family. Nowadays, the Canary Islands are a synonym for that real holiday feeling.
